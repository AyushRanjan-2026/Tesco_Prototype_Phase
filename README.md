# SmartCreative Studio

**A hackathon project for the Tesco Retail Media InnovAItion Jam 2025**

---

## What's This About?

We built SmartCreative Studio because creating retail ads shouldn't require a design team or expensive software. Whether you're a small shop owner promoting this week's deals or a brand manager launching a national campaign, you deserve tools that just work.

Drop in your product photos, tell us what vibe you're going for, and our prototype shows how AI could handle the rest – from generating creative options to checking brand guidelines automatically.

## The Big Idea

We split the problem into two parts:

**Part 1: Make Creation Easy**  
A visual studio where you upload assets, describe what you want, and get polished ad variations. No Photoshop skills needed.

**Part 2: Make Optimization Automatic**  
Once ads are live, they adapt on their own – sunshine means show fresh fruits, lunch rush means highlight meal deals. The system watches and adjusts.

## What You'll Find Here

This prototype demonstrates:

- **Canvas Editor** – Drag, drop, and arrange elements visually
- **AI Generation** – Simulated text-to-design workflow
- **Multi-Format Export** – Instagram, Facebook, in-store displays from one design
- **Brand Compliance** – Automated checks before export
- **Live Dashboard** – Real-time performance metrics that update as you watch
- **Context Triggers** – Weather, store traffic, time of day influencing creative selection

## How We Built It

Just three files, pure web technologies:

```
├── index.html   → Structure and content
├── styles.css   → Visual design system
└── app.js       → Interactive functionality
```

No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies. Open `index.html` in any browser and you're good to go.

## Try It Yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushRanjan-2026/Tesco_Prototype_Phase.git
cd Tesco_Prototype_Phase
open index.html
```

Then:
1. Scroll through to see all the sections
2. Click "Jump Into the Studio" to try the canvas
3. Hit "Generate Options" to see the AI simulation
4. Check out the dashboard with live-updating metrics

## Tech We'd Use (For Real Implementation)

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|-------------|
| Frontend | React, Next.js, TailwindCSS |
| Backend | Node.js APIs, Python for AI services |
| AI Models | Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, OpenCV |
| Real-time | WebSockets for live updates |
| Visualization | D3.js, Chart.js for dashboards |

---

## What's Next?

If we had more time, we'd love to explore:

- Reinforcement learning for truly autonomous optimization
- PDF parsing to automatically extract brand guidelines
- Video and audio asset generation
- Direct integration with Tesco's real data feeds
- Collaborative editing for agency teams

## Who Made This

**Ayush Ranjan** and **Sachin Verma**

We're excited about the intersection of AI and retail media. This prototype is our way of showing what's possible when you combine generative AI with smart optimization.
